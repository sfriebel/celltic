== We need to structure

The world around us gives us information. From chaotic informations we gather data. Data will be put in a list or on a stack or on a table. And we link various pieces of data together. With such a structure we transform data into knowledge. 

Then
 
== We need to categorize

Knowledge needs to be put into appropriate abstract categories. Categories tell us the where, what, when, how and how much and other abstract groups linked with the knowledge data.
  
== We need to sort

To find some data we need also order. We order for numbers and alphabets and we order for space and time. We know political and geographical order. 

== We need to combine

At last we need to work with the knowledge. So we can experiment with it. Or get new data from the old data.


Celltic is going to be a platform independent, freely distributable and easily search, sort and browsable data structure to gather the data about our world.
